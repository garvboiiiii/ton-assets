description: The most down-bad token on the TON blockchain. 
Minted out of pure thirst and zero shame. 
69,000,000,000 $THARKI born from the deepest pits of degen Twitter and the horniest Telegram groups. 
No roadmap. No promises. Just pure meme-fueled madness.  
💧 You don’t buy $THARKI to get rich. You buy it to get noticed by that Telegram mod who left you on read. 
🐶 Made for memers, simps, and that one guy who still thinks Doge is early.
📉 Utility? Nah. It's all vibes. 🚫 No taxes, no team, no VC. 
Just you, your bag, and your bad decisions.  Minted on TON.
Backed by bad ideas and way too much caffeine
